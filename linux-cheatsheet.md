# User Management 

## Add & remove a user

Let us add a user.

```bash
useradd -m username
```

This will add a user with a home directory.  Replace `username` with the username of your choice.

For login screens where seeing a users actual name instead of their username is desired add a `-C` as follows:

```bash
useradd -m username -C "Full Name"
```

The option `-C` denotes that we are commenting the user as their proper name.
Replace `Full Name` with the desired or proper name of the user.

## Adding a user to a group

```bash
usermod -aG group username
```

This command modifies a user to be joined to a group (i.e. sudo).
Replace `group` and `username` with the desired group and username.

## User password

```bash
passwd username
```

This command modifies the password for the user.
You will be prompted for the new user password.

To set a temporary password that will force the user to change their password upon logging in for the first time after setting the password:

```bash
chage -d 0 username
```

What this command does is use the `-d` flag/option to set the age limit of the password to `0`.
This effectively causes the password to immediately expire.
When the user logs in with the password, they will be prompted to change their password.

## Change user type

It is entirely possible to change a user from a "regular" user to a system user.
For example, you might have a system administrator user account that you don't want shown on the login page.
As super user:

```bash
cd /var/lib/AccountsService/users/
```

Edit the file that corresponds with the user you are editing.
The boolean value of `SystemAccount` is by default set to false.

## Log out user

You are able to use the CLI to log out a user.
This can be done using the following command:

```bash
killall -u username
```

The `killall` command has the flag `-u` to tell the system to terminate processes owned by a particular user.
Replace `username` with the username.
This will result in that user getting logged out of their session.

# SSH Key Generation

## ED25519

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

## RSA

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

## Explanation

The above examples will create a SSH key of either type (ED25519 or RSA).
The commands will introduce a prompt which will ask you to name the file of the SSH key.
Some users may prefer to have a separate key generated, but it is not required.
However, checking with your system administrator regarding the specific SSH key policy or practice for your organization is a good idea.

Additionally, you may use the `-C` flag to comment each SSH key.
Some network resources or online services may require or recommend a comment.

# Creating a tarball (archive file)

There may come a time when creating an archive (compressed) file is necessary.
Perhaps it is time to save space, but saving the data is important.
Or you may be manually copying a log of files to a new machine.
This is when creating a tarball (tarring a file or directory) is useful.

## Compressing a directory

To compress a directory simply execute:

```
tar -czvf nameoffile.tar.gz /path/to/directory
```

Where `c` creates the new archive, `z` filters the the archive through `gzip`, `v` gives verbose output, and `f` use the specified archive file (i.e. `nameoffile.tar.gz`).

Replace `nameoffile` with an easy to identify filename.
Replace `/path/to/directory` with the full filepath of the directory.

### Excluding a file or directory

Let us assume that you are creating a tarball of `/path/to/directory` which contains `dir01`, `dir02`, and `dir03`.
For archiving purposes you do not need the contents of `dir02`.
You can exclude `dir02` by executing the following:

```
tar -czvf nameoffile.tar.gz --exclude='dir02' /path/to/directory
```

In this example we are excluding `dir02`.
The `--exclude` flag cannot contain a list of files or directories, so the flag will have to be used for each file or directory you want to exclude.
There is an easier way.

#### Use an exclude file

1. Using your text editor create a file (i.e. `exclude.txt`) and fill each line of the file with a different file or directory as below:

```
dir02
dir04
file3
file4
file9
```

2. Save the file.
3. Execute the following:

```
tar -czvf nameoffile.tar.gz -X exclude.txt /path/to/directory
```

What this will do is exclude any files listed in the exclude file while it creates the archive.

## Check the contents of a tarball

You can check the contents of a tarball by executing:

```
tar -ztvf nameoffile.tar.gz
```

Where `t` lists the contents of the archive.  Flags `z`, `v`, and `f` do as described above.

## Unpacking a tarball

You can unpack the contents of an archive by executing the following:

```
tar -xzvf nameoffile.tar.gz
```

Where the `x` flag extracts from the archive.

To extract to a specific path execute:

```
tar -xzvf nameoffile.tar.gz -C /path/to/destination/
```

Where `-C` changes the target directory to the directory path specified.
